  rewrite the array instead of return a value
misunderstand question
  wrong output
  >= instead of == or > (minimum-size-subarray-sum)
used a wrong variable
be careful of leading zero
Division by zero
rotate-string -> length of string is not the same
def assignNode(node):  # updating `node=xxx` is copy by value only
case of not found
  minimum-size-subarray-sum


# thinking path
if consecutive + 1 < 3  # + 1 is missing

```
i += 1
hoge(i)
```
vs 
```
hoge(i)
i += 1
```
