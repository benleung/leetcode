### Personal Comments


### Feature to judge
- contiguous subarrays
- substring
- find size of longest subarray that ...
- O(N) to solve

### Patterns
longest-continuous-subarray-with-absolute-diff-less-than-or-equal-to-limit
  adjust left's pointer when meet bottleneck at right
design-hit-counter
  not jumping one by one
longest-repeating-character-replacement
  probably the most difficult seen so far
minimum-window-substring
  when move window, adjust counter to indicate a member exists or not
  technique to skip unrelated character
