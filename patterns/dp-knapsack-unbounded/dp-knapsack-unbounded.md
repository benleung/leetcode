# 1-D array is used
`dp[j]`
- `j` (not something usually used for index)
  - for coin-change, this is total value of coins
- `dp[j]`
  - match with question (number of coins)
- `i` is not needed because number of use for each element is unbounded

# Time Complexity
O(MN) where M is target amount, N is number of coins
