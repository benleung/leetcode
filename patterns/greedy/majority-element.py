5' (solution known in 30" but still takes too long to write the code)
- not familiar with dictionary
- should write the hashtable function much faster
- should use max on dictionary

retried a few times, fastest at 0'39" if solution already known

'''
linear time and in O(1) space

assume that the majority element always exists in the array -> very strong
without assumption above, element with little frequency would possible be returned

technique
- candidate technique
    1. major problem: imagine of a competition which one strong majority (more than half of all) vs all other challengers
    2. score for the compeition: count
    3. dun know who is the candidate, but assuming he would try to attack and become candidate by count--, as it becomes the candidate officiailly it would count++
