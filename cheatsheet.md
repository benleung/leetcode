  - write recursion wisely
    - symmetric-tree (practice)
    - dun call recursion too fast because sometimes cannot distinguish left/right
      - e.g. sum-of-left-leaves

- dp-lcs
  - longest-common-subsequence
    - one index for start, one index for end
    ```python
    if text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]:
        dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1  # had mistake here before
    else:
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
    ```

- dp-matrix
  - trick about maximal-square

- dp-longest-palindromic-substring
  - expanding width between left/right indexes
  - width of 0/1 are special cases

- fast-and-slow-pointer
  - can detect cycle linked list
  - can check where cycle begins -> fast and slow to detect conflict -> both slow

- greedy
  - stack is a good way: remove-k-digits
  - combine element -> transverse from right to left (instead of left to right) can be better a substitute for stack

  - how to build a heap? (to revise in future before interview)

- quickselect
  - revise before interview

  - rolling hash
  - edit on the same value (+/-)
  - adjust left's pointer when meet bottleneck at right

- sum-subarray
  - technique: `sumOf(i,j) = sumOf(0,j) - sumOf(0,i-1)`
  - `dp[prefixSum]` <- use prefix sum as index
  - continuous-subarray-sum -> can also train modolus thinking
  - except: left and right product list

  - subsets
    - cascading (allow duplication)
    - cascading (avoid duplicates)
    - backtrack with counters for all combinations, to avoid duplicates -> backtrack
  - combinations
  - combinations (backtrack with counter, technique to skip unnecessary branches)
  - permutations
    - swapping (allow duplication)
    - backtrack (avoid duplicates)
  - same value of different index, avoid duplication -> counter

# easy techniques
- for Elementary Math, use carray, but dun forget last carry
- smart ways to avoid duplicate -> sort -> compare with last node
- 1-to-1: 2 hashmap is required
- stack is a good datastructure for possibly removing/comparing with last element (e.g. valid-parentheses, backspace-string-compare)
- writing while loop/recursive function
  - remember to iterate (`+=`)
  - dun forget actions to do at terminal condition
  - think what the terminal condition will be
- array index
  - opposite index is `length - 1 - i`
- convert into graph to observe the up and down
- queue
  - appendleft -> pop and append -> popleft has the same result (depends on how to want to visualize)


# common careless mistake
- "".join expect each element to be str
- edge cases of 0, empty array, negative
- range(N), upper limit is exclusive (doesn't include N)
- when adding node to queue/stack in tree, think about whether it's None
- when running loop, be careful about the index variable, whether wrongly used the outer one
- remove leading 0, but keep 0 if only one 0 left
- can i use the same element more than once

# knowledge on python
- deque.pop(n) is not O(1) (it is a double linked list, only end or front is O(1))
- set
  - `s1 | s2`  not `s1 + s2`
  - `s1 - s2`
- heap
  - `heapq.nlargest(k,nums.keys(), key=nums.get)` array to return
  - `heapq.nsmallest(k, h.keys(), key=lambda word: (-h.get(word), word))`
- dict
  - del h['a']
- `.copy()` deep copy doesn't work for array inside array

# Datastructure Knowledge
- monotonic deque
  - a queue with increasing numbers/decrease numbers
  - useful for storing a list of "the next max number" / "the next min number"

# Other techniques or topics

## technique of O(1) even space is obviously needed
modify the original array

## array to number
- remove-k-digits
- next-permutation
