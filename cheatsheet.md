# bit manipulations
carry = (a&b) << 1
sum_without_carry = a ^ b
`x & (x - 1)` remove the least significant bit
-x = ~x + 1
mask = 0xFFFFFFFF
x = x & mask
~(a ^ mask)
`x & (-x)` is a way to keep the rightmost 1-bit and to set all the other bits to 0

```python
graph = defaultdict(list) 
```

# sliding-window
- longest-xxxx-substring always think about whether sliding window can be applied
- shortest-xxx-substring is similar
```python
def numSubarrayProductLessThanK(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
  ans = 0
  
  window_size = 0
  cur_prod = 1
  
  for i in range(len(nums)):
      cur_prod *= nums[i]
      window_size += 1
      
      while window_size > 0 and cur_prod >= k:  # point 3
          cur_prod /= nums[i-window_size+1]

  - optimize dp space, by rolling prev/cur

- linked list
  - fixed head
    - remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list
  - variable head
    - reverse-linked-list
  - lru: should use doubly linked list


- backtrack
  - general approach
    - terminal
    - reject
    - add condidate -> clean up
    - branches
  - terminal (side effect, return)

  - often use "index" for backtrack increment

- bit manipulation
  - counting-bits is a classic problem to memorize
    - `dp[x-offset]`
  - power of two/four
    - and operator on non-power of two/four
    - maximum possible value (check whether exist in hex form, 8 charaters 32 bit)
    - `(x - 1) == 0` if only one bit is present
    - find difference by `^=` (e.g. find-the-difference, single-number)
    - there is formula for carry, without carry

- power-of-three
  - not power-of-2/4 so no bit manipulations available
  - consider the base of 3, and write iteration to check each bit

- linkedlist
  - trick of delete node by swapping value





- rotate-arraty
  - use reverse sort twice

- dfs island

  - iterations

- fast-and-slow-pointer
  - can detect cycle linked list
  - can check where cycle begins -> fast and slow to detect conflict -> both slow

- greedy
  - stack is a good way: remove-k-digits
  - combine element -> transverse from right to left (instead of left to right) can be better a substitute for stack

- nsum
  - 2sum, unsorted: hashtable
  - 2sum, sorted: two pointer
  - 3sum: just a more complicated version of 2sum sorted

- sum-subarray
  - technique: `sumOf(i,j) = sumOf(0,j) - sumOf(0,i-1)`
  - `dp[prefixSum]` <- use prefix sum as index
  - continuous-subarray-sum -> can also train modolus thinking
  - except: left and right product list



# easy techniques
- for Elementary Math, use carry, but dun forget last carry
- smart ways to avoid duplicate -> sort -> compare with last node
- 1-to-1: 2 hashmap is required
- stack is a good datastructure for possibly removing/comparing with last element (e.g. valid-parentheses, backspace-string-compare)
- writing while loop/recursive function
  - remember to iterate (`+=`)
  - dun forget actions to do at terminal condition
  - think what the terminal condition will be
- array index
  - opposite index is `length - 1 - i`
- convert into graph to observe the up and down
- queue
  - appendleft -> pop and append -> popleft has the same result (depends on how to want to visualize)
while pile>0:
    hour += 1
    pile -= speed

# common careless mistake
- "".join expect each element to be str
- edge cases of 0, empty array, negative
- range(N), upper limit is exclusive (doesn't include N)
- when adding node to queue/stack in tree, think about whether it's None
- when running loop, be careful about the index variable, whether wrongly used the outer one
- remove leading 0, but keep 0 if only one 0 left
- can i use the same element more than once
- forgetting to add visited before initial
- be careful of order of execution, when modifying index
  ```python
  ch_count_in_window[s[l]] -= 1
  l += 1
  ```
# knowledge on python
- deque.pop(n) is not O(1) (it is a double linked list, only end or front is O(1))
- set
  - `s1 | s2`  not `s1 + s2`
  - `s1 - s2`
- heap
  - `heapq.nlargest(k,nums.keys(), key=nums.get)` array to return
  - `heapq.nsmallest(k, h.keys(), key=lambda word: (-h.get(word), word))`
- dict
  - del h['a']
- `.copy()` deep copy doesn't work for array inside array

# Datastructure Knowledge
- monotonic deque
  - a queue with increasing numbers/decrease numbers
  - useful for storing a list of "the next max number" / "the next min number"

# Other techniques or topics

## technique of O(1) even space is obviously needed
modify the original array

## array to number
